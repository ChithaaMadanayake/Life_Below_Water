                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>Created an engaging homepage with a video background. Used <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> for the video background, with <code>autoplay</code>, <code>loop</code>, and <code>muted</code> attributes to enhance visual appeal. Applied CSS animations for smooth transitions and added a parallax effect for a dynamic feel.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Ensured the site is accessible by using semantic HTML elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to improve screen reader compatibility. Provided descriptive <code>alt</code> text for all images, ensuring that visually impaired users can understand the content through assistive technologies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> 
                        <p><a href="Home.html#splashVal">Link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p>

                    <h3>Link to the page</h3>
                        <p><a href="Home.html">Link to the actual page.</a></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="Table">Table Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>Designed a structured table page for better organization.
                           Designed using <code>table</code> elements, styled for clarity and easy reading. Used <code>nth-child</code> selectors to alternate row colors for better readability.
                        </p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Implemented keyboard navigability for the navigation bar by ensuring all interactive elements, such as links and buttons, are reachable and focusable through keyboard navigation. I also included clear focus styles to help users visually track which element they are interacting with.</p>

                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3>
                        <p><a href="validation_ST0.html#volunteerVal">Link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the validation page and make it jump to the marker that contains a snapshot for the splash page -->

                        
                    <h3>Link to the page</h3>

            <section>
                <h2 id="Content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>Created an informative content page with well-structured data. Structured data using <code>grid</code> and <code>flexbox</code> to create a responsive layout. Applied <code>box-shadow</code> and <code>border-radius</code> for a modern look.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Ensured that the color contrast between the text and background meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for readability by users with visual impairments. Additionally, I used ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks and roles to provide additional context for users with screen readers.
                        By integrating these best practices, the website ensures that all users, regardless of ability, can navigate and access the content effectively, fostering a more inclusive user experience.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> 
                        <p><a href="validation_ST02.html#contentVal">Link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the validation page and make it jump to the marker that contains a snapshot for the splash page -->

                        
                    <h3>Link to the page</h3>
                        <p><a href="content_ST2.html">Link to the actual page.</a></p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Some challenges included ensuring smooth responsiveness across devices and implementing animations effectively. I had to carefully balance performance and design, especially when optimizing the background video for faster load times without sacrificing quality. Additionally, creating a navigation bar that remained functional across different screen sizes and browsers required extra attention to media queries and CSS flex properties.</p>
                <p>Another challenge was debugging complex CSS issues, such as fixing layout shifts and resolving conflicts between different styles. I learned how to use browser developer tools more efficiently to inspect elements, track down errors, and experiment with fixes in real-time. I also faced challenges with ensuring accessibility across all devices, making sure that interactive elements were fully keyboard-navigable and met web accessibility standards.</p>
                <p>Overall, I learned the importance of balancing aesthetics with functionality and performance. The process taught me how to optimize resources, ensure faster page load times, and design for a diverse range of devices and users. This project also deepened my understanding of CSS layout techniques, animations, and accessibility best practices.</p>
